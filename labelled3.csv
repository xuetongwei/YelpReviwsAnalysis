 The ramen Noodle with fish balls has this milky white fish broth definitely a A OK!! A good place for cheap beers and snacks as it opens till 12 AM,Neutral
We Love Zeppes pizza!! For a chain they do a great job with consistency & the pies are very tasty!! Another thing I like is they will always help you with specials if you  Don't have a coupon & they have late hours compared to their competition (that extra hour from 10-11 is a beautiful thing),Positive

 These tacos were about the height of three small fingers with very little fish,Negative

 Worst service Ive ever had in my life,Negative

Oban Sushi does offers a decent and inexpensive Lunch Specials (till 4pm daily) from $4,Positive
99!Sushi Bar Lunch Specials consists of mainly maki but at least they are all made to order and quite fresh!I decided on S2 Sushi Roll ($7,Positive
The salad that came with my meal has way too much dressing and the miso soup was meh,Negative
The rolls though were all quite delicious,Positive
" At this price point, I am not complaining!Of course, there are also AYCE options for both lunch and dinner",Positive
 Service is friendly and courteous,Positive
" Give Oban Sushi a try if you are in the neighbourhood, but avoid the prime lunch hour unless you want to be surrounded by teens",Positive

The food is excellent,Positive
 This is good chinese food well both american cantonese and seshwan',Positive

99 for 24!) and the noodles were great too,Positive

" The ribs were tender on the inside, crisp on the outside and seasoned perfectly",Positive
" The lemon sauce was tangy without being overly sweetened or goopy,  Inexpensive and tasty",Positive
"Typical Chipotle experience, long lines, great food, humanely raised at a decent price",Positive
 One of my favorite quick places to grab a bite to eat that I don't feel guilty over eating,Positive
 I rated this particular Chipotle at a four star because their line moves incredibly slowly compared to other Chipotle's in the valley,Positive
 Friendly group though and upbeat,Positive
 The new sofritas are awesome,Positive
  The best part was SUSHI! Very delicious and super fresh! Big fan:) however they are quite overpriced in my opinion,Neutral
 Might go again for sushi only,Positive
 Really a beautiful spot,Positive
" Updated, modern and smoke-free",Positive
Prices are fair and they come up with some really fun drink ideas and specials,Positive
"awesome food for good prices, excellent service",Positive
" they have great pizza, i will definetly be going back",Positive
"This is by far the best Wendy's! Everyone here is nice and seems happy to be there, the food always seems ""fresh"" and the service is very fast!'",Positive
" No food, no sports on TV",Negative
 The music is always an eclectic mix and the place feels like pretty much anything goes,Neutral
" It's one of the many brightly coloured outlets on West Nicolson Street, and the whole vibe seems to be about relaxation! When I went in to the store, the music was quite cheerful and there're some amusing tid bits on the walls!One one side, lots of posters, post cards and even a hawain shirt are crammed together, giving the place a more personal feeling",Positive
" There's also a calendar behind the counter of some buff  guys professing the importance of surf boards over underwear! They're really decently priced, and serve the most delicious rolls, as well as salads,smoothies and juices, all freshly made! I had a Pink Panther smoothie when I was there ( I can't say the name wasn't a deciding factor) which tasted reallll good",Positive
" Great atmosphere, excellent service, delicious food",Positive
"We always go here in the morning, Enrique is the best and most efficient McDonald's worker I have ever seen",Positive
 They always get our order right and give us as much sauces as we need,Positive
"7 course tasting meal had a wonderful variety of flavours, and each dish was perfect",Positive
" Probably not a huge value in going through each course, as the menu is set and constantly changing - but as long as you don't mind surprises and are open to eating delicious food, this place is for yoh""",Positive
"A little pricier than most places, but that can be controlled",Neutral
"The flavors are good (at least all the ones I've tried), and the toppings are great",Positive
  Excellent variety as well,Positive
"The service felt rushed, our server did not seem interested in being friendly",Negative
" Didn't come back to see if things were fine, just picked up the empty baskets after half an hour",Negative
" For the price paid, the burger was small and I didn't feel like paying $2",Negative
" And on top of that it was somewhat dry, obviously was done on a hot plate and not a grill",Positive
"  I found the assistant who served me to be very pleasant, greeting me with a cheery grin and serving me quickly and efficiently",Positive
"  On the service front, I can't fault them",Positive
"  As far as I can tell, it's a great little local cafe",Positive
 The guy is super nice and answers all questions we have and the flavors are great! Definitely recommend coming here this place has a chill vibe,Positive
 They play good music but not too loud so you're still able to hear the conversations you're having unlike some other club like lounges,Positive
 The employee has offered us free water a few times which we thought was nice as well,Positive
Love the Panda!! Food is much better than you would expect for a national chain chinese,Positive
 None of the dishes are bad and they are always ready to go,Positive
" It wasn't nasty, but it wasn't what I expected",Negative
" I got the 3 strip combo; my fries were cold, Texas toast lacked butter, strips were short and dry and the honey mustard (that I paid $ 40 each for) was watered down",Negative
" The food is okay, it's finger foods right, it goes really well with beer :) Ambiance is nice, even though it was Monday night, it has a good vibe",Neutral
 Service wise,Positive
" Well it's hooters, the waitress are smiley and they are pretty nice",Positive
 But it's kind of weird that we waited a bit longer than usual for our foods as well as our beers,Negative
 The food looks nothing like the photos on yelp,Negative
" The meatballs were dry inside, the brussel sprout salad looks nothing like the photos they were big chunks and not fully cooked, the scallops tiny with no cripsy seared outside and no sauce",Negative
"service, food and wine, i has order A5 mid rare came out it's perfect temperature",Positive
Good food,Positive
 Great value,Positive
" I recommend the lemon chicken, the honey garlic chicken, anything sweet and sour, and the walnut shrimp",Positive
 Those are my faves! They're getting 4 stars because their plain fried rice that comes with the dinner combo is awful,Negative
" But if you order it with all lo mein, they don't charge you extra and it is yummy",Positive
Great place to sit out front and have a beer,Positive
 Great staff,Positive
" They were attentive, cool with our friend's four year old playing with the patio pillows and they had great beer on tap",Positive
" The place is loud , but not overtly so, and has  a lot of colorful, odd, decor",Neutral
  If you bring kids ask to sit near the tree,Neutral
 Manmade tree with all kinds of cool things and animals hanging from it,Neutral
"My salad was good, but lacked color",Neutral
 Lots of lettuce and 1 tiny grape tomato and 1 cucumber slice,Positive
" However, the balsamic vinigrette was very good",Positive
" as for the soup, I had the broccoli/cheese which was tasty",Positive
"  I really wanted to know what the 'soup of the day' was, as it was stated on the menu, but apparently they only had the broccoli and cheese and french onion",Negative
 No daily soup specials,Negative
Overall satisfied with this dining experience,Positive
 The free fountain drink refills are the only positive,Positive
" First, it for the small size, it ought not to take too long to order (however, no biggie)",Negative
" The real issues: staff rather unfamiliar with their own menu, lengthy wait for food after ordering, rather bland food",Negative
"Heck, the server wasn't even sure",Negative
 But the worst part(s): the lettuce on my sandwiches (the original and the replacement) had dead insects in it,Negative
" To make matters worse, so did the complimentary salad that comes with the combo",Negative
" When I brought it up to the attendant, he (well ) didn't bat an eye, no apologies, nor excuses",Negative
" So very unhygienic!""",Negative
"We ordered $50 of take out, most went in garbage.  Can't describe how bad it was",Negative
Fantastic smoothie shop! Vonetta is awesome! Best customer service ever! highly recommend,Positive
 The cheesesteak has a juice that is a mix of meat and cheese that I dream about,Positive
"Perfectly calibrated Dr Pepper fountain in Mentor, for sure",Positive
  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because they accommodated my daughter's special request for a breakfast burrito,Negative
  They gave my wife water when she ordered lemonade,Negative
" The meat was skimpy,  the nachos had melted processed cheese on them",Negative
This place gets two stars only because my wife loves the rellenos,Positive
" I had the fish tacos, could hardly find or taste the fish",Negative
 I was going to give 3 stars but they just refilled my water it taste like they got it from the sewer,Negative
 I was literally drinking the salsa to get the taste out of my mouth,Negative
 I'm sure I won't be coming back unless my wife drags me in for a relleno,Positive
Cold ice cream but portions always seem a little small,Neutral
 You feel like somebody special the second the velvet ropes open for you and even better once you walk in the door,Positive
 The decor of the club is beautiful and the overall vibe is much different and better than any other place in Charlotte,Positive
 You feel like you have walked into a club in NYC or Vegas,Positive
" It significantly reduces the ""riff raff"" which makes the club that much more attractive overall",Positive
They offer just about every quality brand of liquor and exceptional service by the staff,Positive
" The DJ's were excellent both nights, but I especially liked DJ Jus Ske on Friday night",Positive
" Fergie and the rest of the group also performed a couple of songs live, which was pretty cool",Positive
 I love a juicy that isn't overcooked,Positive
" In general, a satisfying and healthy sized sandwich",Positive
" In addition, I was quite pleased with sweet potato fries",Positive
"  As I walked up to it,  I first noticed that from a distance it looks nice (nice sign is what attracted me) but as I approached I saw it was very barren looking.  It really didn't look appealing at all",Negative
  The girl at the cash register had samples and so I had one and it was good so I ordered a 6 piece catfish meal with a side of onion rings and cole slaw,Positive
"  I asked about the cole slaw and the girl behind the counter said it was ""really good""",Positive
  I attempted to pay but there was a problem with the cash register so she went in back to get someone to help her and a young man came out,Negative
  First thing I noticed was that he used the register keys and didn't have gloves on,Negative
"  First of all, the cole slaw is so sweet",Negative
 It has too much slaw sauce on it,Negative
  Much too sweet,Negative
  The onion rings tasted good,Positive
  The catfish was really and I mean really deep fried,Negative
  It didn't taste exactly like the sample I had tasted at the counter,Negative
"  I couldn't really taste the catfish, just the deep fried batter",Negative
  The red dip that came with it was just extremely hot,Negative
  I don't know what it was but it didn't help the flavor of the catfish,Negative
  Here's what really made me angry and caused me to write this review though:  When I was down to the last two pieces of fish I noticed the styrofoam underneath it was eaten away,Negative
  I realized that they must've set the very hot fish directly in the styrofoam tray and it had melted the styrofoam and I had eaten it!!!  I just thought how could someone be so unaware that this could happen?? ,Negative
  It wouldn't take much to spruce the place up,Negative
  Train the employees and make sure they know how to be friendly to the customers,Negative
 Teach them customer service,Negative
   Get rid of the styrofoam or use paper,Negative
  They could have also asked me if I was going to eat there or take it as they could save money on plastic bags by not using them for every order,Negative
Only reason it loses a star is because it's small for a saturday night when the whole room is packed but this is a great place you get treated like family awesome bar mixed drinks arn't their favorite but don't complain if you ask for it and it's not right when they prob never make mixed drinks they are good though,Negative
" Price beats almost everyone! Bar it self beats every bar in area!""",Positive
 They have fast service and great food,Positive
"  This one is no different than the others as far as service and food go, its great",Positive
Ok the food truck came to the Kierland and it was amazing,Positive
 I ordered the Ruben and I just loved it,Positive
" So so so good, I did NOT love the chips, they tasted very plain, but the Ruben was so good it made up for it",Positive
 A few of my coworkers had the Cuban and said that was amazing as well',Positive
"The new ""Chicken Chalupa"" aka chicken shell taco looked really good in the ad, so I got the meal for dinner",Positive
" Even though the rest of the meal (1 hard taco, fries and drink) tasted as usual, the new Chicken Chalupa was disgusting",Negative
 It was like biting into a pile of salt,Negative
 Don't waste your money on this new item unless u like having salt for dinner,Negative
 It took three minutes after that for someone to finally come up and seat us,Negative
" The only thing is that one lady was very friendly and the other was dressed like a stripper, shirt tied in the front, a bandana over her hair, a sparkle belt, and had her stomach hanging out",Negative
" For a family joint this should be unacceptable, there should be a dress code and it should be enforced",Negative
" While waiting on my food then there was two waitresses standing about 15 feet away and my date and I had to have heard the word ""shit"" a solid 5 or 6 times",Negative
 Also I noticed that the whole time that we have been at the restaurant 8:05 pm till 9:20 pm there has been a very little crowd,Negative
 I do not know why that is speaking that it is a Thursday night and I expect this place to be popping like all the others I have been too,Negative
" To top this off again for being so dead it took our food 43 minutes to get to our table, my drink sat empty for 15 minutes along with my dates drink for 12 minutes",Negative
"For fast food, they are really fast! This place is packed and there is a line and it is moving so quickly! The staff and management here are awesome!'",Positive
 I mean really: chilaquiles so close to home?!? They were delicious the first time but it's been a couple months - I need to get back there,Positive
" I mean how can you go wrong with unlimited beer and liquor? First they give you a glass to carry around to sample (yes a actual glass made of glass! They trust us so much) Then its a free for all, about 50 companies are represented here, so theres plenty to sample",Positive
" With so much variety there aren't a lot of long lines, which gives you the opportunity to sample a great deal",Positive
Room for improvement: The biggest let down was the food,Negative
" With a name like ""Beer, Bourbon, and BBQ"" you think they would have a lot of all 3, not so much of the last one",Negative
 Handful of BBQ vendors and hardly any BBQ samples,Negative
" Bathrooms, if you are going to have a big drinking event have lots of toilets, duh",Negative
 There were only about 15 or so port a potties and usually you waited in line for about 10 minutes to use one,Negative
 A good time though and I definitely drank $35 worth of booze,Negative
Usually a bit pricey for me but ordered the Farmhouse salad with roasted turkey and lt,Neutral
  Italian dressing at $4. Let me tell you that is a delicious salad and under 300 cal with light dressing; can't go wrong,Positive
 A bit slow getting it but that's due to them making it fresh,Positive
"  That said, you wouldn't expect such great sushi from this place",Positive
  Why?  There's no seating (all take-out / delivery) and it's nothing but a basic kitchen set up with two guys working the sushi,Negative
  I did some research and found that the owner trained with Japanese Iron Chef himself - Morimoto!  While training is one thing - taste is another and to that point the sushi is fresh and first rate,Positive
"  How do you know they're the real deal?  When they list something on the menu, they actually have it --- unlike most local sushi joints that claim to have certain types of fish only to carry your bulk barn tuna and salmon",Positive
"The BBQ chicken was more like deep fried chicken, the skin was all burnt, the curry chicken has so many little bones inside in the curry and meat was really dry",Negative
"The only good thing was the spring rolls, which were freshly prepared!The restaurant suppose to close at 11 PM and they were mopping the floor while we were eating at 9:45 or so??!!! I don't really like the feeling that the waitstaffs are cleaning up the place with a mop and then turned around to the kitchen and served me my food! Gross!!Sigh",Negative
 I love their lemon loaf,Positive
" But above average than other ""fresh"" products out there (a lot of gluten free breads etc are frozen, or stores sell them frozen)",Positive
"I like how they have an independent cafe, where you can actually get a meal as well -  AND a baked good",Positive
"My real big con is this place is closed on Saturday!!! I don't live near here, and think it's rather ridiculous not to be opened on the ""shopping day"" for most people",Negative
The crispy gnocchi were coated in cheese curds and smothered in braised veal.  What a combination,Positive
" The gnocchi were not heavy, like others I've tried",Positive
 They were lighter and absolutely deep fry-able,Positive
 The veal melted in your mouth,Positive
 Instead of gravy the jus from the veal did the trick,Positive
 Apparently the Arancini is to die for,Positive
 My first thought was maybe my mom should relocate cause if you need a key to get into the bathroom at a establishment then you are probably in a bad area,Negative
 When I opened the door it smelled and looked like death and destruction,Negative
 When my meal comes out I ask for ketchup and the lady hands me 1 pack and tells me she is not allowed to give more than 1 pack per customer,Negative
 My fries were cold,Negative
 Romanburger wasnt even as good,Negative
 Bread was hard and although I said no tomatoes they decided it was best that I get tomatoes,Negative
 unfortunately the pizza Crust is made much more dry and buffalo chicken pizza now has tomatoes which really ruined the flavor,Negative
 Also they are pretty pricey for such a bland and basic pizza,Negative
 The mac and cheese is killer,Positive
 Have had pork ribs and turkey ribs and both were definitely delicious,Positive
 Staff is super friendly,Positive
 This is a great place and the food sells out quickly,Positive
"We went on Father's Day-understaffed, and inexperienced servers, not a good use of space with the tables( could have had many more) and the food, well, we wondered why the table next to us left most of theirs",Negative
"After being served the food we understood why-muffins look great but were dry, the omelet and potatoes tasted like the canned greasethey were fried in (not a hit for our intestines either if you know what I mean, none of us felt that hot an hour later)  and even the salad dressing was gross",Negative
"We left ours too after spending 50 bux, sorry, this place was a miss",Negative
"Indeed this place is a bit of a hole in the wall / hidden gem as it is unassuming with its faded exterior and retro interior but the sushi, sashimi, rolls and rice are outstanding - the salmon was so fresh and light tasting - very quality",Neutral
  The rice is so much better than standard fast food sushi joints - sort of Melt in your mouth,Positive
Had the chicken katsu meal which was great along with a spicy salmon roll and dynamite roll,Positive
" If you're used to the crunchy, shrimp tempura stuffed dynamite roll then you may find these less savoury but you can tell the ingredients are way fresher",Positive
"Not pricey either $40 for katsu chicken, two rolls, salmon sashimi and dessert",Positive

" We ended up waiting far longer, approximately 1.5hours and we live a little more than ten minutes away",Negative

how does a fried chicken restaurant not have thighs and forget food? I am disappointed!',Negative
