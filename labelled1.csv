Pretty standard Chinese food,food
  Never had a bad experience here--it tastes just like you'd expect take out Chinese to taste,food
" When we sat down i had one thing on my mind ""NACHOS PLEASE!!"" Shock and disappointment overcame me when i could not find nachos on the menu! Is this a PUB? Pffftt",food
 But it was okay,food
 What really made my night was the STUPENDOUS Caesar salad,food
" ""Oh come on Cheri"" you say ""It's just a salad""",food
" The dressing was so good! The croutons, yummmy! And the bacon, OH the bacon! It was not fake, it was not bits",food
 It was good bite sized pieces of deliciousness,food
" So when you got a good forkful of salad, you could appreciate the bacon-y goodness with every bite",food
 I wouldn't give this place a 4 star just for a salad though,food
 But my bf ordered the rib and wing combo with sweet potato fries,food
 I tried some ribs and they were really good,food
 Flavourful with fall-off-the-bone tenderness,food
" Also, the sweet potato fries were fried up perfectly",food
 Nice and crispy,food
 And the sauce that came with them was good too,food
 The atmosphere here is a bit blah,ambience
" I'm sure it's much better in the summer, and the patio looks awesome",ambience
" Very big, with a great location next to the beach",ambience
 The food will definitely bring be back here again to try some more,food
  The staff is ambivalent at best,serivice
"  We had one question for our waitress, how big  the pitcher (like in how many ounces)?  Her response?  ""Look in here, it should say"" while she hands me back the menu",serivice
"  Her next response was that it was ""normal"" size and walked away",serivice
"  I will tell you this, she wasn't lying, these plates were scorching hot, as in I could not even touch it to move it on the table",ambience
 The food was at best mediocre,food
  My burrito was filled with greasy pork and covered in bland rachero sauce,food
  My friends fajita quesadilla was passable (though quite small),food
"  I will say I typically do not have very high expectations for ""house"" margaritas, I'm expecting inexpensive tequila, but these margaritas didn't even meet those low standards",food
"  They were neon green and tasted of pure sweet and sour mix, not a whiff of tequila was detectable in smell or taste",food
  My friend and I finished half a glass each of the concoction before we decided we could stomach no more,food
 Our waitress took 20 minutes to come back and check on us ,serivice
  We get to the front cash register and there is no one there,serivice
"  We wait 3 or 4 minutes, still no one there",serivice
"  Finally the manger comes out, we explain (in an extremely polite way) that we were simply not happy with the margaritas",food
Kids running around no one tells them anything,ambience
" Rice hard tastes a day old, pico de gallo no flavor also tastes old, chicken tooooo dry, flies flying everywhere",food
 Location dirty and very loud,ambience
 HEY MANAGER you need time management!!! I ordered two doughnuts (not the ones I like) They were out of the UN GLAZED ????? But never the less I would gladly eat what I had ordered ,serivice
 I ordered a large coffee and was told I would have to wait for ,serivice
  The manager said 20 minutes to wait for coffee,serivice
"  Tell you the truth, I am giving up on doughnuts and certainly this place needs new management for sure",serivice
"The food is good, if your going to use take out order in advance and ask for more meat, they can be a little light",food
"Very cool neighborhood charming ""dive"" bar with a newly added stage for Live music",ambience
"  Excellent bar food and fish sandwiches and cheap, good draft beer",food
Can't say too much about this handy restaurant,serivice
" Neat and tidy, good and quick customer service, and really tasty selection of meals to pick from","food,serivice,ambience"
 There is also a small produce section which looks pretty clean but I never bought anything from there before,ambience
 I don't see any fresh fish or meat,food
 All frozen,food
"Every weekend, come early for their fresh vegetable and beef rolls",food
 Delicious and runs out very quickly! I almost had to punch an old Filipino lady to get my fix! Right next door to a delicious Filipino restaurant,food
Their weekend Dim Sum is pretty good but I'd pass on the rest of their food,food
  Their General Tso's chicken had the consistency of chewing gum,food
"Mayfield Village is an amazing Chinese takeaway which has a good atmosphere, pleasant service, but incredible food","food,serivice,ambience"
"  I've been here twice and both times the meal was served in generous, filling portions and probably tasted better than any other Chinese I've been to",food
  The menu is extensive and has a full range of authentic Chinese dishes,food
  The staff were proper friendly and the order only took about five minutes to be cook,serivice
"  I would have waited ten times as long for it because it just tasted so good!  The last time I was there I went for te salt and pepper squid which, again, was amazing",food
  Their prices are as you would expect with mains costing around xc2xa35,price
  If you're after top quality Chinese takeaway food then this is the place to come,food
COME HERE!!!!  First found about this restaurant on yelp looking for a hangover cure so decided to try it out with some of my friends visiting from Cali and boy is it the best Mexican Food I've ever had!! and its real authentic Mexican food,food
 The service is amazing and food is sure to more than satisfy your taste buds and that hangover,"food,serivice"
$2 for a bottle of beer?! I guess I am IN!Tea & Kitchen just opened up on Steeles between Kennedy and Birchmount has a really mixed menu that has items from Chinese and Japanese cuisine,"food,price"
 The ramen Noodle with fish balls has this milky white fish broth definitely a A OK!! A good place for cheap beers and snacks as it opens till 12 AM,"food,price"
We Love Zeppes pizza!! For a chain they do a great job with consistency & the pies are very tasty!! Another thing I like is they will always help you with specials if you  Don't have a coupon & they have late hours compared to their competition (that extra hour from 10-11 is a beautiful thing),"food,serivice"
" Zeppes is very good as is the help!! Never had a rude experience yet & the help is xtra friendly!!""","food,serivice"
"New location, very clean, fast friendly service! Perfect for a quick grab and go lunch","food,serivice,ambience"
I unfortunately fell into the trap pf ordering chips and salsa first,food
 Way too much food,food
" Big serves, as often happens in Mexican, and fresh ingredients","food,serivice"
 Nothing earth-shattering but reasonably priced,price
"very average subs,  I ordered online and they forgot to give us our chips even though we paid for them","food,serivice"
"  The meatball sub was ok, the bread is not very good",food
  I would equate this with a subway meatball sub and that is not saying much,food
"I loved this place so much!  delicious, fresh, so reasonably priced and excellent service; a hole in the wall with run by such a super sweet family - have to highly recommend it!'","food,serivice,price"
 The chicken is a nice white meat with good flavor and a crispy breading,food
 I really enjoyed both dishes,food
" This place is a hole in the wall, but the food is good","food,ambience"
 I will definitely be returning to try more on the menu,food
"Solid casual sushi restaurant!Didn't try the sashimi, so can't validate quality of fish, but rolls and tempera were decent",food
Service was quick and polite,serivice
" Will come back again, especially for lunch special which was surprisingly filling",price
 This is a deli that does stand out among the others in the area,ambience
" Add soup, a drink and crisps and that adds up to a very tasty lunch for about xc2xa37 or so",food
" Light and airy, lots of papers and magazines to flick through and plenty of seats and tables",ambience
" Cold food, kinda pricey for what you get and not very good when there are lots of newer breakfast places opening up all around (Cora's, eggsmart, sunset grill, etc)Wish I could give it no stars","food,price"
" The pictures of their food is beautiful, inside if the shop is very clean",ambience
 These tacos were about the height of three small fingers with very little fish,food
" As for taste, they're pretty good",food
 Simply because the novelty didn't meet expectations and price was not worth it,price
  Royal Dumpling is a semi new place that opened up,ambience
" Dumplings are ""supermarket"" quality",food
  Long wait time if place is busyI've passed this place a number of times on my way home from work,serivice
  Royal Dumpling is a tuiny place that replaced a pizza place,ambience
  The inside looks exactly the same as the pizza place,ambience
  They did very little renovation after taking over,ambience
  The place is super tiny,ambience
  The place is so tiny the kitchen is located the floor above,ambience
"We ordered the Fennel and Nappa dumplings, some lamb skewers and the beef noodle",food
"  When it's busy, expect to wait a long time",serivice
  We waited nearly 40 minutes for our food,serivice
  That's way too long,serivice
The dumplings themselves were average at best,food
  They were obviously not hand made,food
  These dumplings I swear were like the ones you can buy at the supermarket,food
"  At $7 for 15, they were also more expensive then your usual dumpling",price
"Being disappointed by the dumpling, I was very impressed with the skewers and noodles",food
 The skewers were some of the better ones I've had,food
  They were spicier than others and that's the way I like it,food
  The noodles were pretty good too,food
"  The dumplings aren't horrible, but they aren't anything to rave about either",food
"  Both sons loved and, more importantly, ate their entire meal",food
 The ribs were sauced but not sticky and not greasy at all,food
" They have several sauces on the table so you can choose your level of sweet, tang or hot",food
 I had tangy and found the sauce really enhanced the ribs,food
 The fries are crispy but not very salty,food
 I'm not a barbeque snob but I do come from Memphis and this meal was quite tasty,food
"If you like your playground slide to smell like urine, this is the place",ambience
" If you like flies with your fries, good spot",food
" If you want three ice cubes in your gallon sized soda, enjoy!'",food
Love this place! The food is delicious and the staff is wonderful,"food,serivice"
" We've always enjoyed our meals here and the prices can't be beat!""","food,price"
  Honestly it was the most amazing BBQ I've ever had,food
The portions were generous,food
" The manager in a purple shirt looked at me 3 times, but did not seat me",ambience
" Finally I was seated, but then was forgotten",ambience
 I felt so completely unwelcome and humiliated,ambience
" My 2 year old son started to cry and kept repeating ""drink!"" which after 25 minutes we still had not received",ambience
" When I was shot a bad glance from another server, I was done",ambience
 Worst service Ive ever had in my life,ambience
Awesome  chicken,food
 It still never lasts very long,ambience
Oban Sushi does offers a decent and inexpensive Lunch Specials (till 4pm daily) from $4,"food,price"
99!Sushi Bar Lunch Specials consists of mainly maki but at least they are all made to order and quite fresh!I decided on S2 Sushi Roll ($7,food
The salad that came with my meal has way too much dressing and the miso soup was meh,food
The rolls though were all quite delicious,food
" At this price point, I am not complaining!Of course, there are also AYCE options for both lunch and dinner","food,price"
 Service is friendly and courteous,serivice
" Give Oban Sushi a try if you are in the neighbourhood, but avoid the prime lunch hour unless you want to be surrounded by teens",food
great foodnice ambiancewe have ordered more take out than eaten inOn site the service is friendly and the ambiance nice,"food,ambience,serivice"
The food is excellent,food
 This is good chinese food well both american cantonese and seshwan',food
I loved the Hot &Sour soup and the dumplings were top notch,food
99 for 24!) and the noodles were great too,food
 I was less impressed with the General Tso chicken; I found the sauce a little goopy and wasn't thrilled with seasoning,food
 I will definitely return for the soup and dumplings,food
"Update: Went back again and tried the lemon chicken, crispy beef short ribs and beef with black bean sauce on rice noodles, plus some more of those dumplings and all of them were excellent",food
" The ribs were tender on the inside, crisp on the outside and seasoned perfectly",food
" The lemon sauce was tangy without being overly sweetened or goopy,  Inexpensive and tasty","food,price"
"Typical Chipotle experience, long lines, great food, humanely raised at a decent price","food,price,serivice"
 One of my favorite quick places to grab a bite to eat that I don't feel guilty over eating,food
 I rated this particular Chipotle at a four star because their line moves incredibly slowly compared to other Chipotle's in the valley,serivice
 Friendly group though and upbeat,ambience
 The new sofritas are awesome,food
  The best part was SUSHI! Very delicious and super fresh! Big fan:) however they are quite overpriced in my opinion,"food,price"
 Might go again for sushi only,food
 Really a beautiful spot,ambience
" Updated, modern and smoke-free",ambience
Prices are fair and they come up with some really fun drink ideas and specials,"food,price"
"awesome food for good prices, excellent service","food,price,serivice"
" they have great pizza, i will definetly be going back",food
"This is by far the best Wendy's! Everyone here is nice and seems happy to be there, the food always seems ""fresh"" and the service is very fast!'","food,serivice"
" No food, no sports on TV","food,ambience"
 The music is always an eclectic mix and the place feels like pretty much anything goes,ambience
" It's one of the many brightly coloured outlets on West Nicolson Street, and the whole vibe seems to be about relaxation! When I went in to the store, the music was quite cheerful and there're some amusing tid bits on the walls!One one side, lots of posters, post cards and even a hawain shirt are crammed together, giving the place a more personal feeling",ambience
" There's also a calendar behind the counter of some buff  guys professing the importance of surf boards over underwear! They're really decently priced, and serve the most delicious rolls, as well as salads,smoothies and juices, all freshly made! I had a Pink Panther smoothie when I was there ( I can't say the name wasn't a deciding factor) which tasted reallll good","food,price"
" Great atmosphere, excellent service, delicious food","food,ambience,serivice"
"We always go here in the morning, Enrique is the best and most efficient McDonald's worker I have ever seen",serivice
 They always get our order right and give us as much sauces as we need,serivice
"7 course tasting meal had a wonderful variety of flavours, and each dish was perfect",food
" Probably not a huge value in going through each course, as the menu is set and constantly changing - but as long as you don't mind surprises and are open to eating delicious food, this place is for yoh""",food
"A little pricier than most places, but that can be controlled",price
"The flavors are good (at least all the ones I've tried), and the toppings are great",food
  Excellent variety as well,food
"The service felt rushed, our server did not seem interested in being friendly",serivice
" Didn't come back to see if things were fine, just picked up the empty baskets after half an hour",serivice
" For the price paid, the burger was small and I didn't feel like paying $2",price
" And on top of that it was somewhat dry, obviously was done on a hot plate and not a grill",food
"  I found the assistant who served me to be very pleasant, greeting me with a cheery grin and serving me quickly and efficiently",serivice
"  On the service front, I can't fault them",serivice
"  As far as I can tell, it's a great little local cafe",food
 The guy is super nice and answers all questions we have and the flavors are great! Definitely recommend coming here this place has a chill vibe,"food,serivice"
 They play good music but not too loud so you're still able to hear the conversations you're having unlike some other club like lounges,ambience
 The employee has offered us free water a few times which we thought was nice as well,serivice
Love the Panda!! Food is much better than you would expect for a national chain chinese,food
 None of the dishes are bad and they are always ready to go,food
" It wasn't nasty, but it wasn't what I expected",ambience
" I got the 3 strip combo; my fries were cold, Texas toast lacked butter, strips were short and dry and the honey mustard (that I paid $ 40 each for) was watered down",food
" The food is okay, it's finger foods right, it goes really well with beer :) Ambiance is nice, even though it was Monday night, it has a good vibe","food,ambience"
 Service wise,serivice
" Well it's hooters, the waitress are smiley and they are pretty nice",serivice
 But it's kind of weird that we waited a bit longer than usual for our foods as well as our beers,serivice
 The food looks nothing like the photos on yelp,food
" The meatballs were dry inside, the brussel sprout salad looks nothing like the photos they were big chunks and not fully cooked, the scallops tiny with no cripsy seared outside and no sauce",food
"service, food and wine, i has order A5 mid rare came out it's perfect temperature",food
Good food,food
 Great value,price
" I recommend the lemon chicken, the honey garlic chicken, anything sweet and sour, and the walnut shrimp",food
 Those are my faves! They're getting 4 stars because their plain fried rice that comes with the dinner combo is awful,food
" But if you order it with all lo mein, they don't charge you extra and it is yummy","food,serivice"
Great place to sit out front and have a beer,"food,ambience"
 Great staff,serivice
" They were attentive, cool with our friend's four year old playing with the patio pillows and they had great beer on tap","food,serivice"
" The place is loud , but not overtly so, and has  a lot of colorful, odd, decor",ambience
"My salad was good, but lacked color",food
 Lots of lettuce and 1 tiny grape tomato and 1 cucumber slice,food
" However, the balsamic vinigrette was very good",food
" as for the soup, I had the broccoli/cheese which was tasty",food
"  I really wanted to know what the 'soup of the day' was, as it was stated on the menu, but apparently they only had the broccoli and cheese and french onion",food
 No daily soup specials,food
 The free fountain drink refills are the only positive,serivice
" First, it for the small size, it ought not to take too long to order (however, no biggie)",food
" The real issues: staff rather unfamiliar with their own menu, lengthy wait for food after ordering, rather bland food","food,serivice"
"Heck, the server wasn't even sure",serivice
 But the worst part(s): the lettuce on my sandwiches (the original and the replacement) had dead insects in it,food
" To make matters worse, so did the complimentary salad that comes with the combo",food
" When I brought it up to the attendant, he (well ) didn't bat an eye, no apologies, nor excuses",serivice
" So very unhygienic!""",ambience
"We ordered $50 of take out, most went in garbage.  Can't describe how bad it was",food
Fantastic smoothie shop! Vonetta is awesome! Best customer service ever! highly recommend,"food,serivice"
 The cheesesteak has a juice that is a mix of meat and cheese that I dream about,food
"Perfectly calibrated Dr Pepper fountain in Mentor, for sure",food
  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because they accommodated my daughter's special request for a breakfast burrito,serivice
  They gave my wife water when she ordered lemonade,serivice
" The meat was skimpy,  the nachos had melted processed cheese on them",food
This place gets two stars only because my wife loves the rellenos,food
" I had the fish tacos, could hardly find or taste the fish",food
 I was going to give 3 stars but they just refilled my water it taste like they got it from the sewer,food
 I was literally drinking the salsa to get the taste out of my mouth,food
 I'm sure I won't be coming back unless my wife drags me in for a relleno,food
Cold ice cream but portions always seem a little small,food
 You feel like somebody special the second the velvet ropes open for you and even better once you walk in the door,ambience
 The decor of the club is beautiful and the overall vibe is much different and better than any other place in Charlotte,ambience
 You feel like you have walked into a club in NYC or Vegas,ambience
" It significantly reduces the ""riff raff"" which makes the club that much more attractive overall",ambience
They offer just about every quality brand of liquor and exceptional service by the staff,"food,serivice"
" The DJ's were excellent both nights, but I especially liked DJ Jus Ske on Friday night",serivice
" Fergie and the rest of the group also performed a couple of songs live, which was pretty cool",serivice
 I love a juicy that isn't overcooked,food
" In general, a satisfying and healthy sized sandwich",food
" In addition, I was quite pleased with sweet potato fries",food
"  As I walked up to it,  I first noticed that from a distance it looks nice (nice sign is what attracted me) but as I approached I saw it was very barren looking.  It really didn't look appealing at all",food
  The girl at the cash register had samples and so I had one and it was good so I ordered a 6 piece catfish meal with a side of onion rings and cole slaw,food
"  I asked about the cole slaw and the girl behind the counter said it was ""really good""",food
  I attempted to pay but there was a problem with the cash register so she went in back to get someone to help her and a young man came out,serivice
  First thing I noticed was that he used the register keys and didn't have gloves on,serivice
"  First of all, the cole slaw is so sweet",food
 It has too much slaw sauce on it,food
  Much too sweet,food
  The onion rings tasted good,food
  The catfish was really and I mean really deep fried,food
  It didn't taste exactly like the sample I had tasted at the counter,food
"  I couldn't really taste the catfish, just the deep fried batter",food
  The red dip that came with it was just extremely hot,food
  I don't know what it was but it didn't help the flavor of the catfish,food
  Here's what really made me angry and caused me to write this review though:  When I was down to the last two pieces of fish I noticed the styrofoam underneath it was eaten away,food
  I realized that they must've set the very hot fish directly in the styrofoam tray and it had melted the styrofoam and I had eaten it!!!  I just thought how could someone be so unaware that this could happen?? ,food
  It wouldn't take much to spruce the place up,ambience
  Train the employees and make sure they know how to be friendly to the customers,serivice
 Teach them customer service,serivice
   Get rid of the styrofoam or use paper,food
  They could have also asked me if I was going to eat there or take it as they could save money on plastic bags by not using them for every order,serivice
Only reason it loses a star is because it's small for a saturday night when the whole room is packed but this is a great place you get treated like family awesome bar mixed drinks arn't their favorite but don't complain if you ask for it and it's not right when they prob never make mixed drinks they are good though,"food,ambience"
" Price beats almost everyone! Bar it self beats every bar in area!""",price
 They have fast service and great food,"food,serivice"
"  This one is no different than the others as far as service and food go, its great","food,serivice"
Ok the food truck came to the Kierland and it was amazing,food
 I ordered the Ruben and I just loved it,food
" So so so good, I did NOT love the chips, they tasted very plain, but the Ruben was so good it made up for it",food
 A few of my coworkers had the Cuban and said that was amazing as well',food
"The new ""Chicken Chalupa"" aka chicken shell taco looked really good in the ad, so I got the meal for dinner",food
" Even though the rest of the meal (1 hard taco, fries and drink) tasted as usual, the new Chicken Chalupa was disgusting",food
 It was like biting into a pile of salt,food
 Don't waste your money on this new item unless u like having salt for dinner,food
 It took three minutes after that for someone to finally come up and seat us,serivice
" The only thing is that one lady was very friendly and the other was dressed like a stripper, shirt tied in the front, a bandana over her hair, a sparkle belt, and had her stomach hanging out",serivice
" For a family joint this should be unacceptable, there should be a dress code and it should be enforced",serivice
" While waiting on my food then there was two waitresses standing about 15 feet away and my date and I had to have heard the word ""shit"" a solid 5 or 6 times",serivice
 Also I noticed that the whole time that we have been at the restaurant 8:05 pm till 9:20 pm there has been a very little crowd,ambience
 I do not know why that is speaking that it is a Thursday night and I expect this place to be popping like all the others I have been too,ambience
" To top this off again for being so dead it took our food 43 minutes to get to our table, my drink sat empty for 15 minutes along with my dates drink for 12 minutes",serivice
"For fast food, they are really fast! This place is packed and there is a line and it is moving so quickly! The staff and management here are awesome!'",serivice
 I mean really: chilaquiles so close to home?!? They were delicious the first time but it's been a couple months - I need to get back there,food
" I mean how can you go wrong with unlimited beer and liquor? First they give you a glass to carry around to sample (yes a actual glass made of glass! They trust us so much) Then its a free for all, about 50 companies are represented here, so theres plenty to sample",serivice
" With so much variety there aren't a lot of long lines, which gives you the opportunity to sample a great deal",serivice
Room for improvement: The biggest let down was the food,food
" With a name like ""Beer, Bourbon, and BBQ"" you think they would have a lot of all 3, not so much of the last one",food
 Handful of BBQ vendors and hardly any BBQ samples,food
" Bathrooms, if you are going to have a big drinking event have lots of toilets, duh",ambience
 There were only about 15 or so port a potties and usually you waited in line for about 10 minutes to use one,ambience
 A good time though and I definitely drank $35 worth of booze,price
Usually a bit pricey for me but ordered the Farmhouse salad with roasted turkey and lt,"food,price"
  Italian dressing at $4. Let me tell you that is a delicious salad and under 300 cal with light dressing; can't go wrong,"food,price"
 A bit slow getting it but that's due to them making it fresh,food
"  That said, you wouldn't expect such great sushi from this place",food
  Why?  There's no seating (all take-out / delivery) and it's nothing but a basic kitchen set up with two guys working the sushi,ambience
  I did some research and found that the owner trained with Japanese Iron Chef himself - Morimoto!  While training is one thing - taste is another and to that point the sushi is fresh and first rate,food
"  How do you know they're the real deal?  When they list something on the menu, they actually have it --- unlike most local sushi joints that claim to have certain types of fish only to carry your bulk barn tuna and salmon",food
"The BBQ chicken was more like deep fried chicken, the skin was all burnt, the curry chicken has so many little bones inside in the curry and meat was really dry",food
"The only good thing was the spring rolls, which were freshly prepared!The restaurant suppose to close at 11 PM and they were mopping the floor while we were eating at 9:45 or so??!!! I don't really like the feeling that the waitstaffs are cleaning up the place with a mop and then turned around to the kitchen and served me my food! Gross!!Sigh","food,serivice"
 I love their lemon loaf,food
" But above average than other ""fresh"" products out there (a lot of gluten free breads etc are frozen, or stores sell them frozen)",food
"I like how they have an independent cafe, where you can actually get a meal as well -  AND a baked good","food,ambience"
"My real big con is this place is closed on Saturday!!! I don't live near here, and think it's rather ridiculous not to be opened on the ""shopping day"" for most people",serivice
The crispy gnocchi were coated in cheese curds and smothered in braised veal.  What a combination,food
" The gnocchi were not heavy, like others I've tried",food
 They were lighter and absolutely deep fry-able,food
 The veal melted in your mouth,food
 Instead of gravy the jus from the veal did the trick,food
 Apparently the Arancini is to die for,food
 My first thought was maybe my mom should relocate cause if you need a key to get into the bathroom at a establishment then you are probably in a bad area,ambience
 When I opened the door it smelled and looked like death and destruction,ambience
 When my meal comes out I ask for ketchup and the lady hands me 1 pack and tells me she is not allowed to give more than 1 pack per customer,serivice
 My fries were cold,food
 Romanburger wasnt even as good,food
 Bread was hard and although I said no tomatoes they decided it was best that I get tomatoes,food
 unfortunately the pizza Crust is made much more dry and buffalo chicken pizza now has tomatoes which really ruined the flavor,food
 Also they are pretty pricey for such a bland and basic pizza,price
 The mac and cheese is killer,food
 Have had pork ribs and turkey ribs and both were definitely delicious,food
 Staff is super friendly,serivice
 This is a great place and the food sells out quickly,food
"We went on Father's Day-understaffed, and inexperienced servers, not a good use of space with the tables( could have had many more) and the food, well, we wondered why the table next to us left most of theirs","food,ambience,serivice"
"After being served the food we understood why-muffins look great but were dry, the omelet and potatoes tasted like the canned greasethey were fried in (not a hit for our intestines either if you know what I mean, none of us felt that hot an hour later)  and even the salad dressing was gross",food
"We left ours too after spending 50 bux, sorry, this place was a miss","food,price"
"Indeed this place is a bit of a hole in the wall / hidden gem as it is unassuming with its faded exterior and retro interior but the sushi, sashimi, rolls and rice are outstanding - the salmon was so fresh and light tasting - very quality","food,ambience"
  The rice is so much better than standard fast food sushi joints - sort of Melt in your mouth,food
Had the chicken katsu meal which was great along with a spicy salmon roll and dynamite roll,food
" If you're used to the crunchy, shrimp tempura stuffed dynamite roll then you may find these less savoury but you can tell the ingredients are way fresher",food
"Not pricey either $40 for katsu chicken, two rolls, salmon sashimi and dessert",price
"Wings and sliders are great, burgers are meh, beer is good, but the OTB really brings down the energy",food
 The feeling of hopelessness follows OTB like a desperate ex-girlfriend,food
"We ordered from Uber eats, and the initial wait time was about 40 minutes",serivice
" We ended up waiting far longer, approximately 1.5hours and we live a little more than ten minutes away",serivice
" The pizza was really cold and Soggy so my guess is that it was more an Uber issue than the pizza, but Parma doesn't exactly strike me as an Uber Hotspot so that could also be the issue",food
"Noodles were very good but a bit salty, and the rest was very good",food
 Good price as well,price
 The staff is very attentive and professional,serivice
" The food is very good, my favorite is lamb",food
 The ambiance is modern unlike other Russian restaurants,ambience
I keep getting disillusioned with What A Bagel because of the prices,price
  A medium container of cream cheese is $13,price
 A challah bread is $5,price
This is the kind of salad/soup/sandwich place I've been hoping Charlotte would get,food
"  It's stylish, clean, and it's got a well laid-out menu board with plenty of options, so there's bound to be something everyone likes",food
" The line moves quickly and when I went yesterday, it was packed",serivice
 The folks working behind the counter were very friendly and quick to offer up their favorites and popular menu items,serivice
"Kind of like Crisp, you've got gourmet salads, or you can create your own",food
"  Prices wise, the gourmet salads range from $6 for a classic caesar, to $9",price
"50 for the tilapia, which I had, and was really yummy","food,price"
"  (Parmesan crusted tilapia, warm on carrots, edamame, bail and spring mix w/sesame ginger dressing) My only improvement would be to cook the fish less",food
" The edges were just a bit too crisp/tough, but the center was moist and flavorful",food
"My dining partner had the BBQ Santa Fe salad, which was excellent too-- chicken and corn, black beans, cilantro, cheese and tortilla strips",food
"We also had one of the soups of the day, a crab corn chowder, which was excellent, and frankly, could have been served at Upstream in a fancy bowl and nobody would have looked twice",food
"You can also get wraps, flatbreads and kids items (mmm, Nutella and berry wrap!), along with side items that are a bit more unique than at say, Subway, and more on-par with Au Bon Pain Think, Ms Vicky's chips, baked chips, and those little hummus containers with flat pretzel chips",food
"You'll pay less here than at Dean and Deluca (and honestly, they have most of the same salad items here maybe even more when you count the different proteins, like teriyaki chicken and pork tenderloin) and won't be overwhelmed with salad like at Crisp","food,price"
This location's service is just a tad ahead of the curve above every other Harvs location,serivice
"Authentic, fresh, and consistently delicious",food
" The menu is on the sparse side, but the dishes offered hit the mark",food
 The salsa verde is PERFECT: tangy and tasty with just the right hit of fresh cilantro,food
 You'll enjoy scooping it up with their homemade tortilla chips,food
 The beef tacos are generously filled; make sure to top them with fresh onion and cilantro,food
" If you can, try sharing a bunch of dishes; you can't go wrong",food
"As for the ambiance: on the plus side, it feels like you're sitting in someone's kitchen",ambience
"  The cooks are right there, prepping, frying, pouring",ambience
" On the minus side, it feels like you're sitting in someone's kitchen",ambience
 It's not the most comfortable dining experience and there's something about the layout that just doesn't sit well with me,ambience
 BUT I'm enchanted by the flavours and will keep on coming back again and again,food
 Derek and his partner on the line were helpful and friendly,serivice
 And the food being made in front of you is nice to see,food
 Loved it: smelled and tasted great!',food
 The bartenders were friendly & made an effort to get to know you,serivice
 After our second visit the bartender already knew my drink of preference,serivice
 They had great food too,food
" Really good chicken fingers!""",food
" DO NOT BE FOOLED this was by far the worst sushi I've ever had, and I've had sushi in Mexico",food
"The service was horrible, didn't even get a menu until sitting for 10 minutes",serivice
 The food was even worse,food
" I thought I'd be safe by getting a spicy salmon roll, but I was sadly mistaken",food
 This thing did not even look like a roll,food
 It had a huge chunk of what seemed like a few days old raw salmon in a horrible cream sauce,food
 I had to make a big effort not to spit it out when I was chewing it,food
" The other rolls were just okay, but the spicy salmon ruined my entire meal",food
"It took another 20 minutes for us to get the bill, and left one of us quite sick after our lunch",serivice
served me cooked sushi when i ordered raw,food
 refused to refund me,serivice
 very bad service from owner,serivice
 Froyo usually costs us at least $2 more dollars per person for about the same amount of ice cream,price
The kids like the mix in options and they have more ice cream flavors than I remember,food
 Ice cream is delicious too,food
The only complaint is that sometimes the portions between orders is inconsistent,serivice
 This is a super cute cafe ; very big with lots of seating and great lighting,ambience
" There are tons of teas, coffee beverages and unique beverages like the pumpkin spice latte and turmeric latte",food
" The meal was flavorful and tasted so very clean! I felt so full, but in the best way, after the salad",food
 The turmeric latte was very good as well -- I was surprised that it paired well with the coconut milk! As a proponent and fan of turmeric (haldi) I was pleased with the fact you could actually taste the turmeric,food
 The fact that they even had this was amazing!! Turmeric is so good for your health -- definitely try it out,food
"I think this place is great!  2 can eat a full dinner (tea, soup, appetizer of choice, 2 sides (1 rice & 1 noddle dish) and 2 ""entree"" options for under $30",price
  Their Take-Out is also ready in record time,serivice
 Under 15 minutes,serivice
" The restaurant has a good amount of seating, so go ahead and bring a mid sized group for dinner",ambience
"Before I get into the food, the service at Cucina Locale is close to my heart",serivice
" I'm about -20% Italian, but from start to finish, the staff will make you feel like you're around friends, and the food willhave you thinking that your nonna made it",serivice
" What can't be denied about the pizzas at Cucina Locale is that they're FRESH to def! You get that grandmother feel because from the freshly baked crust to the vividly flavourful prosciutto, the ingredients assure you that they were recently prepared",food
" That being said, there's more to a drop dead amazing pizza than outright freshness",food
" The Locale is a great pizza with classic, simple flavours, but it doesn't have the legs to be the best",food
" It was a stellar addition to the pie, giving it bouts of vibrant, salty flavour that sits on your pallet long after the meal",food
"Come through to Cucina for a delightful dinner and stellar service!""",serivice
" Delicious, spicy as you would expect from a place called Chili King, and very friendly service","food,serivice"
Great service and great coffee,"food,serivice"
I just got back from Bojangles and am pretty disappointed,food
"  First I ordered my food and they ""forgot"" to mention they have no more thighs until I already paid",serivice
" So they tried to replace it with 1 wing, seriously? I got two out if them but still that is ridiculous",serivice
" Then I got the food and checked it, my boyfriend got a 3 piece meal and they only put one one leg and their last thigh, they forgot the third piece",food
how does a fried chicken restaurant not have thighs and forget food? I am disappointed!',serivice
The cherry tabulah was outstanding,food
" Dried cherries, not couscous but buckwheat berries or something, fennel, raw cauliflower (personally, I think they should have been blanched a bit but still delicious)  cherry pomegranate dressing",food
 I will be back for that NO DOUBT!The spicy apricot quinoa was delicious too,food
" So flavorful and tasty with just the right amount of spice to kick it up a notch!My friend ordered the no preservtive, all beef angus hotdog and he really enjoyed it",food
 I want the zucchini lasagna,food
"If you like delicious, good food, and a very decent price, this is it!""","food,price"
 Overall great experience!!! The best crunch wrap supreme,food
MacAlpine's Soda Fountain is all right be me,food
"It's a cool place to meet up with some friends for an ice cream treat, soda or float",food
"  The food is OK, not great but not bad either",food
  The ice cream and soda treats are fantastic!  The ambiance ~ the soda bar is cool and there are two side rooms full of antiques that are for sale everywhere,"food,ambience"
"I've had their Reuben which was A-OK and on my last trip I sampled their burger and chips with chocolate shank which was shank-a-licious!!   My burger was cooked well, but nothing fancy",food
  I also had a small salad which was nice but not memorable,food
  My shake was really good and left an indelible impression on my taste buds,food
Omg I'm officially hooked! I was so happy to see that they have a veggie hotdog called the veggie dog!!  love that they offer the soy based dog! You'll never know its soy based! The flavor is on point & love the lime to squeeze on as extra flavor,food
 Nathans has good stuff,serivice
hot dogs are good,food
the fries are good,food
I liked this location because it's next to hot dog on a stick,ambience
"There are plenty of TVs about, so not an entirely bad place to watch a game",price
"  Food is always cold, slimy and/or stale",food
"  The location on Sloane was pretty bad, but they moved to this new location and the food actually got worse!  Poorly managed, I'd recommend going to another location",ambience
" But if you want to let your date knows how thrifty you are, this is the place to come for dim sum $1.98 for all sizes and on top you get 10% off!! Dim sum selections are quite standard but all the ones that we tried were decent",price
I honestly think people are missing the biggest thing on the menu which is the special DEEP FRIED CHICKEN,food
 This is my 100% go to because the fried chicken tastes so freaking good with the gravy that comes with the plate,food
ask for extra gravy sauce because its that delicious,food
 This is the place if your on a budget and its good portion size,price
